### Basic <a name="mbasic"></a>

>#### Create
>Java was created by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems in 1991.  Java was officially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

>#### ByteCode
>Bytecode in Java refers to the intermediate, platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler from the source code. The bytecode is a set of instructions that is designed to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

>#### Characteristics
>- Platform Independence
>- Object-Oriented
>- Simple and Easy to Learn
>- Robust and Secure
>- Multi-threaded
>- Distributed Computing
>- Dynamic and Extensible
>- High Performance
>- Rich Standard Library
>-  Community Support

### Difference <a name="mdiffer"></a>

#### Differance bw Java & C++
| Feature                     | Java                                  | C++                                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Platform Independence**   | Platform-independent (JVM)            | Platform-dependent compilation            |
| **Memory Management**       | Automatic garbage collection         | Manual memory management (new, delete)     |
| **Language Paradigm**       | Object-oriented                      | Supports both procedural and OOP           |
| **Multiple Inheritance**    | Through interfaces                   | Supports multiple inheritance directly    |
| **Compiler vs. Interpreter**| Compiled to bytecode, executed by JVM | Compiled directly to machine code          |
