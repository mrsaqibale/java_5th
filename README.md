### Basic <a name="mbasic"></a>

>#### Create
>Java was created by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems in 1991.  Java was officially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

>#### ByteCode
>Bytecode in Java refers to the intermediate, platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler from the source code. The bytecode is a set of instructions that is designed to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

>#### Characteristics
>- Platform Independence
>- Object-Oriented
>- Simple and Easy to Learn
>- Robust and Secure
>- Multi-threaded
>- Distributed Computing
>- Dynamic and Extensible
>- High Performance
>- Rich Standard Library
>-  Community Support

### Difference <a name="mdiffer"></a>

#### Differance b/w Java & C++

| Java                          | C++                               |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Platform Independence         | Platform-Dependent Compilation    |
| Automatic Memory Management   | Manual Memory Management         |
| Object-Oriented               | Procedural and Object-Oriented    |
| Multiple Inheritance (via interfaces) | Multiple Inheritance Directly  |
| Compiled to Bytecode (JVM)    | Compiled Directly to Machine Code |

### JVM & JDK & JRE

| **Aspect**                        | **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** | **JDK (Java Development Kit)** | **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Functionality**                 | Executes Java bytecode        | Full development kit with tools | Runtime environment for Java apps   |
| **Components**                    | Virtual Machine              | Compiler, JRE, Development Tools | JVM, Class Libraries                |
| **Purpose**                       | Provides runtime environment | Comprehensive development kit   | Minimum requirements for runtime    |
| **Key Role**                      | Translates bytecode, memory management | Compilation, development, debugging | Executes bytecode, provides libraries |
| **Usage**                         | Installed on host machine    | Used by developers for Java development | End-users need it to run Java apps  |

### OOP Concepts <a name="moop"></a>

#### Classes and Objects in Java
##### Class
A class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It serves as a prototype that defines the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects instantiated from the class will possess.

In Java, a class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name. Here is an example of a `Student` class:

```java
public class Student {
    // Attributes of the Student
    String name;
    int age;
    String studentAridNo;
    // Behaviors
    void study() {
        // Implementation
    }
    void attendClass() {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `Student` class has attributes (`name`, `age`, and `studentAridNo`) that represent properties of a student, and it has behaviors (`study` and `attendClass`) that represent actions a student can perform.

##### Object

An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the blueprint defined by the class. Objects have state (values for attributes) and behavior (execution of methods).

Objects are created from a class using the `new` keyword. For example, creating an instance of the `Student` class:

```java
Student myStudent = new Student();
myStudent.name = "John Doe";
myStudent.age = 20;
myStudent.studentAridNo = "S12345";
myStudent.study();
```

In this example, `myStudent` is an object of the `Student` class. It has specific values for the attributes `name`, `age`, and `studentId`, and it can invoke the methods `study` and `attendClass` defined in the `Student` class.
